# CookingCharts
Charts to help with the cooking process. When I cook, my food always comes out at different times. I have a hard time visualizing the process in my head. That's why I created these Cooking Gantt Charts.

## Usage
[speculation here, please improve] - run cooking timeline.R?

## Contents
* cooking_timeline.R - the main file
* recipe1.txt - a recipie 

### Please help me make this app a reality so I can get better at cooking!
