# CookingCharts
Charts to help with the cooking process. When I cook, my food always comes out at different times. I have a hard time visualizing the process in my head. That's why I created these Cooking Gantt Charts.

## Usage
Download Cooking_Timeline_App.R and run with R Studio to view cooking timelines.

## Contents
* Cooking_Timeline_App.R - the main shiny app file
* cooking_timeline.R - file containing raw work as I work through Gantt Chart visualization and Natural Language Processing 
* recipe1.txt - a recipe 

### Please help me make this app a reality so I can get better at cooking!
